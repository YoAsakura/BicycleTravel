        <p class="block-description__desc wow">
          Is it more profitable to buy or assemble yourself?
          In almost all variants, a self-assembled bike will be more profitable than a purchased one.
          Rule of thumb: if your budget is less than $ 1,500 (~ ₱ 75,000) or even $ 1,700 (~ ₱ 93,000), it is much more
          profitable to buy a pre-assembled bike, especially if it is last year's model.
        </p>
        <h3 class="block-description__heading wow">How much does a mountain bike cost?</h3>
        <p class="block-description__desc wow">
          Mountain bike prices in the Philippines range from ₱ 18,000.
          The prices for new generations of mountain bikes in the Philippines can be as high as: 1,200,000 и, and
          although innovative technology has been used for these bikes, there is no particular need to purchase such a
          bike, you can still enjoy riding on a cheaper version.
